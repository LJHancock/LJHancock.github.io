Here you can find all my (hopefully) interesting projects!

<h3> Mobile Egypt: Summer Research </h3>

<h3> Mobile Egypt: Dissertation </h3>

<h3> Formula Student: Data Visualisation of High Performance Car Data Using Virtual Reality </h3>

Currently a work in progress to be completed as part of my MEng degree. The project works closely with the Formula Student team we have on campus to give them the data visualisation tools they need. It has also become an excuse to play with my new toy, Oculus Rift.
