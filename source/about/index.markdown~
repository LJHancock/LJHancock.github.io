Hey, I'm Lewis. Currently an MEng student at Swansesa University with a passion for Human-Computer Interaction and Game Development. How people interact with technology is becoming more important and applying this to game development is what excites me the most.

I also have an interest in 3D Graphics, Augmented and Virtual realities and Game Design.

When not sat behind a keyboard you'll find me enjoying live folk music, juggling or skiing.
