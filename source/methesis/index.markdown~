##Aims
An evolution of the Mobile Egypt: Summer Project. This was used as my third year disseration at Swansea University. The goal was to further improve the user experience and engagement in the summer project by removing the need for an image. This allows the user to aim the tablet camera directly at the object that interests them, displaying a 3D model on the screen. This can then be rotated and manipulated by touch input and moving the tablet.

##Technology Used
The project uses the Unity3D engine, scripted with C#. The object recognition is powered by OpenCV and C++. Then it is all packaged up in Android!
